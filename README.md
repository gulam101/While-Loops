While-Loops
Practicing on While Loops

I made this on the console application, and I was playing around with the while loops and ensuring went to break out of them. This was just some practise and ensuring that I understood when to use them and how to use them.

I can use this simple tutorial if I need to remember and practise things I learnt. I also can use it to show new developers the basics of C# and this can serve as a reminder to some experienced developers who might need to recap on this knowledge.
